CSS3dDice
=========

Pretty accurately described by the title, the 3d effect and animation is done in CSS, with a bit of javascript to make them roll. I'll post a link to an example shortly.


Installation and use
--------------------

Link in the files `diceStyle.css` and `dice.js`.
`1player.html` and `2player.html` show examples of use.
